                <h1>Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard</h1>
                <p>When is the last time you washed your belly button? In a studied published in PLOS ONE, researchers found 2,368 species of bacteria in just 60 belly button samples.
                    Today our wesite will allow you to explore some test subjects who allowed us to test their belly buttons for what bacteria was contained with in them.
                    The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
                    We hope this will allow all who see it to consider spending some extra time to make sure they are washing themselves properly to help prevent infections or any vicious bacteria to grow.

It seems that though you cannot get rid of all the bacteria no matter how much you wash. But the more that you do the less likely you will have so many different kinds stored with in your naval.

            <h1>What does this mean??</h1>
            <p>Bacteria is hard to get rid of. It can get anywhere, or on anything, and looks for the small cracks to live and mutiply in. This data set shows us individuals wash rate per week, as in showering them selves and surprisingly some even reported that they dont shower at all.
                But we often found that the more washing a person does in a week the less likely they are to have as much bacteria in their naval as someone who doesnt take many baths or any if at all. if you would like more information pertaining to this data set and the study behing it please visit the following link <a href="url">http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/</a>
